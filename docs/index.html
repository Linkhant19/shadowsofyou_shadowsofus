                            I called you at 1:16 am <br>
                            I never meant to burden you with my emotions<br>
                            I just wanted to distract myself<br>
                            from the voices telling me to<br>
                            1. Take the anger off me and throw it to him through text<br>
                            2. Scramble up my thoughts and scream them to myself<br>
                            3. Grab my water bottle and smash it in my head.<br>
                            <br>
                            You assured me again and again that you were here for me<br>
                            <br>
                            but I couldn’t speak <br>
                            without breaking down into pieces<br>
                            I whimpered, “I can’t do this.”<br>
                            I can’t do this. <br>
                            I can’t. <br>
                            <br>
                            But, you can. <br>
                            You can do better. <br>
                            You can escape. <br>
                            You can leave.

                            We were walking home from the library<br>
                            And I told you I’ve been way too stressed and <br>
                            I’ve yet to see brighter days.<br>
                            <br>
                            Right before we parted ways, <br>
                            You stopped me <br>
                            You opened your arms<br>
                            and I could already feel your embrace.<br>
                            <br>
                            I couldn’t speak<br>
                            I thought, “I have never done the same for her.”<br>
                            I have never. <br>
                            I never do.<br>
                            <br>
                            But, you do.<br>
                            You always treat me better.<br>
                            You can escape.<br>
                            You can leave.

                            after everything that we have been through<br>
                            someone in my mind is telling me <br>
                            that you should leave<br>
                            before I fuck it all up.

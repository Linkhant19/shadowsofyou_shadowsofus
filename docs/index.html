                            We are all scared when things have been too good for us. <br>
                            We are all there when life is passing out bad decisions. <br>
                            It feels like just the other day <br>
                            I was scared of showing you my messy room. <br>
                            Now one of us is throwing up on the bathroom floor. <br>
                            One of us is crying on the hardwood floor. <br>
                            One of us is in the kitchen cooking for four. <br>
                            And one of us, even if he’s not, just looks so pure. <br>
                            <br>
                            And, everything feels normal and I just keep falling in love. <br>
                            I have never thought a home here is something that I deserve.<br>
                            And, to be perfectly honest, <br>
                            I still don’t think I deserve<br>
                            you. All of you.

                            In that dimly lit room on a Friday night, <br>
                            I saw shadows of us. <br>
                            But, not the ones that haunt me in the middle of the night. <br>
                            This time, I wanted to dance. <br>
                            I wanted to sing. <br>
                            I wanted to lift you up<br>
                            and swing. <br>
                            <br>
                            And, everything feels normal and I just keep falling in love.<br> 
                            I have never thought your company is something that I deserve.<br>
                            And, to be perfectly honest, <br>
                            I still don’t think I deserve<br>
                            you. All of you.
